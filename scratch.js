// How to print to the console, the second most important thing to learn in any language.
console.log("I'm a real boy")

// example of hoisting
console.log (thing = "something")
// variables
// Declared, using very specific words. 
// let- a mutable variable, the value can be changed. This may be reassigned. 
let myName = "Kyle" // String begins with ", ', `, and contain characters
// = is the assignment operator, this DOES NOT represent equality

// const- is a immutable variable, meaning it cannot be reassigned. 
const theSky = "is blue" 

// var- is mutable, and is contained in the global scope.
// It receives the super power of hoisting. 
var thing = "hoisted"

// Primitive values, are the most generic values. The types of data in their simplest form.
console.log(typeof myName, "<<<This is me checking the variable myName")
console.log("this a >>>>", typeof 1)
console.log("this is a >>", typeof 12.3) // float is anything with a decimal
console.log("This is a >>", typeof true)
console.log("this is a >>", typeof false)
console.log("This is >>>", typeof null) // this is the developer setting this value explicitly, this is a reserved keyword
console.log("this is >>", typeof undefined) // this is random

// evrything in javacript is true, except 
// "", 0, null, undefined, false, NaN - Not a Number
