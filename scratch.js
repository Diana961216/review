// Declared, using very specific words. 
// let- a mutable variable, the value can be changed. This may be reassigned. 
let myName = "Kyle" // String begins with ", ', `, and contain characters
// = is the assignment operator, this DOES NOT represent equality

// const- is a immutable variable, meaning it cannot be reassigned. 
const theSky = "is blue" 

// var- is mutable, and is contained in the global scope.
// It receives the super power of hoisting. 
var thing = "hoisted"
